We spent 2 nights here eating and having drinks (as patrons of the attached Verb Hotel) and the second night, we were literally locked out.  We went out to the pool with a cocktail to enjoy the night, and when my husband tried to go back in the patio door to get one last drink at 10:45pm, the door was locked.  Mind you, a sign had been been put up that said the door would be locked at 11:00pm.  That was even new to us, because we did the exact same thing on Tuesday night, and had no problem going back in for a drink at 11:30pm.  Upon asking for a Manager, she said she could not help me and informed me I would have to wait IN LINE to re-enter at the front door.  This is after being there for 3 hours and being guests of the hotel!  I then tried to express my concerns to the lady at the front desk of the hotel, and she also said she could not help because the restaurant was not owned by them.  Completely unacceptable!  Food was great, but after being treated like this, we won’t be back.",

            "text": "Anyone complaining about the price needs to realize where they are and the type of restaurant they are in. I decided to try brains for the first time here. Absolutely delicious. I always say don't knock it till you try it. I also had their salmon sushi. The rolls fell apart slightly but tasted good. After my meal I realized why they charge $12 for a drink. I left with a wonderful buzz and no mad cow disease from the boiled brains. I say that's worth a rant and a rave. Would recommend to anyone who'd like to try something new.",
